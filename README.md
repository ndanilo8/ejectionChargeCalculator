## Pyrotechnic Charge Calculator for Parachute Ejection in High Power Rocketry

### Brief Explanation

This Pyrotechnic Charge Calculator is a simple tool designed for use in High Power Rocketry to estimate the amount of pyrotechnic charge needed to pressurize a container for parachute ejection from the fuselage. High Power Rocketry often involves deploying parachutes to ensure a safe and controlled descent of the rocket after the main thrust phase. The parachute ejection system typically uses a pyrotechnic charge to rapidly generate gas, creating pressure inside the container that deploys the parachute.

### Goal

The goal of this calculator is to provide rocket enthusiasts and designers with a quick and efficient way to estimate the necessary amount of pyrotechnic charge for a specific container volume and desired pressure. The calculator takes into account the expected temperature and height above sea level to adjust the pressure calculation. By using this tool, rocketry enthusiasts can accurately determine the required pyrotechnic charge, ensuring a reliable and successful parachute ejection during the flight. This calculator can aid in optimizing the parachute deployment system and contribute to the overall safety and performance of high-power rockets.

### Usage 
Input Parameters: Once the calculator application starts running, you will be prompted to enter several input parameters:

1. Enter the **container volume** in cubic meters. This value represents the internal volume of the container that needs to be pressurized for parachute ejection.
2. Enter the **required pressure** in Pascals. This value represents the desired pressure inside the container for successful parachute deployment.
3. Enter the **expected temperature** in Celsius. This is the temperature at which you anticipate the parachute ejection event to occur.
4. Enter the **height above sea level** in meters. This value is necessary to adjust the pressure calculation based on the altitude.
