# Pyrotechnic Charge Calculator for Parachute Ejection in High Power Rocketry

## Brief Explanation

The Black Powder Charge Calculator for Rocket Parachute Ejection is a practical tool designed to provide an approximation of the amount of black powder required for successful parachute deployment in high-powered rockets. This calculator is especially useful for rockets measuring around 3-4 inches in diameter. It assists rocket hobbyists, builders, and engineers in determining the appropriate amount of black powder needed to achieve the desired parachute ejection pressure.

## Key Features:
**User-Friendly Interface:** The calculator offers a simple and user-friendly interface, enabling users to input key parameters conveniently.

**Input Parameters:**
- **Diameter** of Parachute Section **Body Tube**: The user provides the diameter of the cylindrical body tube section in centimeters(cm) where the parachute is housed.
- **Length** of Parachute Section **Body Tube**: The length of the cylindrical body tube section in centimeters(cm) where the parachute is housed is specified by the user. (cm)
- **Desired Pressure**: Users can input their target pressure in pounds per square inch (PSI), which influences the parachute deployment.

**Accurate Calculations:** The calculator utilizes precise mathematical formulas to determine the amount of black powder required for parachute deployment. It considers the volume of the cylinder, desired pressure, and other crucial factors.

**Safety Considerations:** The tool emphasizes safety, as it is essential to ground test the parachute deployment before the first launch. Users are advised to keep a safe distance from the rocket during testing.

**Grams of FFFFg Black Powder:** After inputting the necessary values, the calculator promptly computes and displays the amount of FFFFg black powder required in grams for successful parachute ejection.

## Note: 
The calculator assumes FFFFg black powder and provides an approximate value. The actual deployment performance may vary due to real-world conditions, so it is crucial to conduct thorough ground tests for optimal results.
